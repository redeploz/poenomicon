## Introduction

The [Raise Spectre](https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Raise_Spectre) skill allows you to raise the corpse of a defeated monster as a minion to fight for you.
As of patch 3.10, almost all monsters in the game are spectreable, including league specific ones. This means there are a lot of good options for both DPS
and utility spectres, so this repository aims to collect the most effective/interesting spectre choices in a central place.

## DPS Spectres

### Solar Guard

Post 3.10, these were probably the most commonly used DPS spectres, as they feature two powerful spells (Fireball/Special Beam Cannon) with no auto attack.

Clearspeed: great<br/>
Single-Target: good

[poedb-link](https://poedb.tw/us/mon.php?n=Solar+Guard)

<h4>Example Supports</h4>

Spell Echo - Greater Multiple Projectiles - Minion Damage - Elemental Focus - Concentrated Effect

### Goatman Fire-Raiser

Very similar to Solar Guards, they also use Fireball as their main spell but also feature Magma Orb and Molten Shell.

Clearspeed: great<br/>
Single-Target: good

[poedb-link](https://poedb.tw/us/mon.php?n=Goatman+Fire-raiser)

<h4>Example Supports</h4>

Spell Echo - Greater Multiple Projectiles - Minion Damage - Elemental Focus - Concentrated Effect

### Enhanced Vaal Fallen

One of the few viable melee DPS spectres, mainly because they use Elemental Hit and never use their auto attack. They can feel a bit clunky because they
feature two different stances and in their default stance their movement speed is VERY low. Once they switch to their combat stance, their movement speed
increases and they start to use a flame dash ability.

Clearspeed: mediocre<br/>
Single-Target: good

[poedb-link](https://poedb.tw/us/mon.php?n=Enhanced+Vaal+Fallen)

<h4>Example Supports</h4>

Minion Damage - Minion Speed - (Multistrike/Melee Splash) - Ruthless - Fortify - Feeding Frenzy

### Frost Sentinel

Powerful clearspeed spectre with only a single spell (various versions of ice spear).

Clearspeed: great<br/>
Single-Target: mediocre

[poedb-link](https://poedb.tw/us/mon.php?n=Frost+Sentinel)

<h4>Example Supports</h4>

Spell Echo - Greated Multiple Projectiles - Minion Damage - Elemental Focus - Elemental Army

### Flame Sentinel

Powerful clearspeed spectre with only a single spell (various versions of fire ball).

Clearspeed: great<br/>
Single-Target: mediocre

[poedb-link](https://poedb.tw/us/mon.php?n=Flame+Sentinel)

<h4>Example Supports</h4>

Spell Echo - Greated Multiple Projectiles - Minion Damage - Elemental Focus - Elemental Army

### Tukohama's Vanguard

They summon scorching ray totems which makes them a solid choice for single target but their clearspeed is really low.

Clearspeed: bad<br/>
Single-Target: great

[poedb-link](https://poedb.tw/us/mon.php?n=Tukohama%27s+Vanguard)

<h4>Example Supports</h4>

Minion Damage - Burning Damage - Multiple Totems - Elemental Focus - Efficacy

## Tank Spectres

### Kitava's Herald

Something of a hybrid between DPS and Tank spectre, they feature an extremely large HP pool as well as some physical based attacks and spells

Clearspeed: good<br/>
Single-Target: mediocre

[poedb-link](https://poedb.tw/us/mon.php?n=Kitava%27s+Herald)

<h4>Example Supports</h4>

Minion Damage - Brutality - Greater Multiple Projectiles - Spell Echo - Feeding Frenzy

### Solaris Champion

Melee spectre that uses various melee attacks as well as a spark-like fire tornade that is triggered on usage of its double strike ability. It also has the ability
to summon two animated weapons, but unfortunately it seems like they are only summoned once upon entereing a zone and then never again. All in all this spectre is
pretty interesting and looks amazing, but is very limited in terms of damage.

Clearspeed: good<br>
Single-Target: mediocre

[poedb-link](https://poedb.tw/us/mon.php?n=Solaris+Champion)

<h4>Example Supports</h4>

Minion Damage - Multistrike - Feeding Frenzy - (Greater Multiple Projectiles/Slower Projectiles) - Fire Penetration

### Lunaris Champion

Counterpart of the Solaris Champion, they use various melee attacks including ice crash. They can also summon a banner that emits a hatred aura, but it seems like its only summoned once at the first combat encounter in a zone and then never again. Pretty much the same drawbacks as Solaris Champions but worse clearspeed.

Clearspeed: mediocre<br/>
Single-Target: mediocre

[poedb-link](https://poedb.tw/us/mon.php?n=Lunaris+Champion)

<h4>Example Supports</h4>

Minion Damage - Multistrike - Melee Physical Damage - Fortify - Feeding Frenzy

### Stoneskin Flayer

A true tank spectre, they have an extremely high HP pool and use a whirling charge melee attack.

Clearspeed: mediocre<br/>
Single-Target: mediocre

[poedb-link](https://poedb.tw/us/mon.php?n=Stoneskin+Flayer)

<h4>Example Supports</h4>

Minion Damage - Brutality - Melee Physical Damage - Fortify - Feeding Frenzy

## Utility Spectres

### Undying Evangalist

Very useful defensive utility spectre due to their proximity shield. As long as you are in the proximity shield bubble, you don't take damage from sources outside of the shield.

[poedb-link](https://poedb.tw/us/mon.php?n=Undying+Evangelist)

<h4>Example Supports</h4>

Blood Magic - Increased Duration - Meat Shield

### Carnage Chieftain

Useful as a support for other minions, they cast a warcry that grants fenzy charges to all nearby allies. Blood Magic is basically mandatory as they have a very limited mana pool.

<h4>Example Supports</h4>

Blood Magic - Meat Shield

### Host Chieftain

Useful as a support for other minions, they cast a warcry that grants power charges to all nearby allies. Blood Magic is basically mandatory as they have a very limited mana pool.
